1. Ryan Hobson
2. I am interested in the data science program because I love statistics. Unfortunately I didn't take a stats class as an undergrad until my senior year. So I didn't know I liked it until too late. I then remembered I liked it while getting my MBA. I work with data in my job and figured I should finally invest some time studying a subject I love and improving my skill set for work.
3. I took my first programming courses during my MBA. I learned VBA and took one course that used R. I fell in love with R and a few years after my MBA I got a certificate in in through the University of Washington. I haven't used it as work as much as I'd like however. 
4. I've taken 3 statistics courses between undergrad and graduate school. I do use it at work as I work with data almost every day. But I use very basic stats as I don't feel comfortable enough with the sophisticated approaches.
5.  I have experience with R mainly through the certificate program?
6.  I hope to become a little more comfortable with the statistical concepts. The certificate taught me the R language but blew through concepts.
7.  No. Just excited to learn and hope to apply this at work so it sticks.
